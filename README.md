<!-- What We Used -->
<h2 id="setup"> :floppy_disk: What We Used</h2>

### These are the different tools we used and where you can find them for use on your own project:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a></b> - Used a model from Hugging Face to classify resumes and make sure they have the right keywords</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://streamlit.io//">Streamlit</b> - Without Streamlit, there would be no app! Everything is coded in Streamlit</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</b> - We used Jupyter Notebook to train a model and clean our datasets</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</b> - We would not be able to model our data in Jupyter Notebook without the Pandas library.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</b> - Every bit as crucial to our data modeling as Pandas.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</b> - We used it, but that doesn't mean what we did made it into our app...</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</b> - Used OpenAI API to generate the cover letter</li>
</ul>

### Along the way, we relied heavily on a diverse set of resources...and here they are:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/">Plotly</b> - A great reference point for several types of visual models</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</b> - Every time we got stuck on a bit of code, ChatGPT was there to help us out.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/theming">Streamlit Theming</b> - Valuable for helping to adjust the theme of our streamlit app</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</b> - Where we went to find the datasets for our visuals and to train our models.</li>
</ul>
